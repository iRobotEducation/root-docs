## Mechanical

### Top Magnets

Root has ten small magnets underneath the top surface to help with attaching accessories. These 5mm-diameter magnets are in a 32mm x 32mm grid as shown in the image below. Each magnet has the North pole facing up. You can use these to hold accessories in place by gluing magnets to your accessory that line up with the magnets in Root. (*Make sure the magnets are facing the right direction first!*)

## Electrical

Root has the ability to provide power to an accessory from the USB-C port. When the robot detects an Upwards Facing Port, e.g. a USB device, rather than a USB charger or host it will supply 5V with a maximum of 250mA to the VBUS pin of the USB-C port.

[This cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-Type-C-Micro-B-Cable/dp/B01LONQBDG/) has been verified to work with the robot.
